#🌾 Crop-Recommendation-System
A machine learning-powered web application designed to help farmers select the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Developed as part of a graduate capstone project by Kishan, Bansikumar and Jenish. The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict the best crop based on input data such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Predicts the ideal crop based on environmental and soil parameters.
- Incorporates multiple ML models like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN for optimal crop selection.
- Flask-based web interface for simple and accessible user interaction.
- Visualizations to show data insights and evaluate model performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## 📊 Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy and robustness in crop prediction.

## 💡 How It Works
1. Users input environmental data such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and climate conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.).
2. The system processes the input using a trained machine learning model to provide crop recommendations.
3. The web interface provides dynamic predictions with a simple click of a button.
